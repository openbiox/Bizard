    "text": "Example\n\n\n\n\n\nThis density plot illustrates the distribution of expression levels for the TSPAN6 gene across multiple samples. The x-axis represents the data values (e.g., gene expression levels ranging from 8 to 15), while the y-axis represents density, not absolute counts. The y-axis can be interpreted as the “relative frequency” of data values within a specific interval. The total area under the density curve is 1, representing the relative probability distribution of the data across the x-axis. In simpler terms, it measures the proportion of samples within a specific value range relative to the total sample size.\nUnlike histograms, which use absolute frequencies on the y-axis, density plots use density values, resulting in a smoother representation of data distribution. This allows for a clearer visualization of the data’s central tendency and overall distribution characteristics.\nThe plot shows that the expression levels of the TSPAN6 gene are concentrated between 10 and 13, with a peak around 12, indicating that most samples have relatively consistent expression levels. The unimodal distribution suggests that the expression pattern of TSPAN6 is stable across most samples.",

Basic Density Plot\nIn the ggplot2 package, you can create a density plot using geom_density, which requires only a numeric variable as input.\n\n# Basic Density Plot \np1 &lt;- ggplot(data1, aes(x = expression)) +   \n  geom_density(fill = \"#69b3a2\", color = \"#e9ecef\", alpha = 0.8) +   \n  labs(title = \"Density Plot of TSPAN6 Expression Levels\",        \n       x = \"Expression\",        \n       y = \"Density\") +   \n  theme_minimal()  \np1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Basic Density Plot\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the distribution of expression levels of the TSPAN6 gene across multiple samples from LIHC patients sourced from TCGA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\ntheme_ipsum You can use the theme_ipsum from the hrbrthemes package: it is easy to use and makes your charts look more professional. As you can see, theme_ipsum() comes with a set of pre-configured settings, such as font size, color, and gridlines, which adhere to good visualization practices, are well-designed, and are ready for publishing.\n\nggplot(data1, aes(x = expression)) +\n  geom_density(fill = \"#69b3a2\", color = \"#e9ecef\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  labs(title = \"Density Plot of TSPAN6 Expression Levels\",\n       x = \"Expression\",\n       y = \"Density\") +\n  theme_ipsum()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Themed Density Plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Mirrored Density Plot\nThe mirror density plot helps us intuitively compare the distributions of two datasets. Through the mirrored structure, we can quickly determine whether the two datasets exhibit symmetry or differences. The mirror density plot combines two density plots into a single graph, reducing the required visualization space while maintaining a clear description of the data distribution.\n\n# Create a mirrored density plot \nggplot(data12, aes(x = expression, fill = var)) +\n\n  # Draw the upper density curve\n  geom_density(data = filter(data12, var == \"var1\"), aes(y = ..density..), fill = \"#69b3a2\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  geom_label(data = filter(data12, var == \"var1\"), aes(x = median(expression), y = 0.25, label = \"TSPAN6\"), color = \"white\", fill = \"#1b9e77\") +\n  \n  # Draw the lower density curve\n  geom_density(data = filter(data12, var == \"var2\"), aes(y = -..density..), fill = \"#404080\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  geom_label(data = filter(data12, var == \"var2\"), aes(x = median(expression), y = -0.25, label = \"C1QA\"), color = \"white\", fill = \"#7570b3\") +  \n\n  # Beautify the plot\n  xlab(\"Expression\") +\n  ylab(\"Density\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Mirror Density Plot of TSPAN6 and C1QA\") +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Mirrored Density Plot\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3 demonstrates the expression distribution of the TSPAN6 and C1QA genes in LIHC patients sourced from TCGA. The same approach can also be used to generate a mirrored histogram.\n\n\n3. Multiple Groups Density Plot\nA multi-group density plot allows for an intuitive comparison of the distribution differences between different groups, helping to identify trends, patterns, and outliers, while presenting data from multiple groups on the same plot, making it easier to compare group characteristics. However, when there are many groups or the distribution curves overlap, the plot can become cluttered, making it difficult to distinguish the differences between groups, which reduces the readability of the chart. Transparency adjustments can be made to reduce visual interference from overlapping areas. However, this method can only improve the visualization to a certain extent and is not a universal solution. Other plotting methods discussed later in this document (e.g., facet density plots) can be used to resolve this issue.\n\n# Without transparency (left)\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=diamonds, aes(x=price, group=cut, fill=cut)) +\n  geom_density(adjust=1.5) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  ggtitle(\"p1\")\n\n# With transparency (right)\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=diamonds, aes(x=price, group=cut, fill=cut)) +\n  geom_density(adjust=1.5, alpha=.4) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  ggtitle(\"p2\")\n\nplot_grid(p1, p2, ncol = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Multiple Groups Density Plot Using the Diamonds Dataset\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 compares the density distributions of the diamonds dataset’s price under different transparency settings. The left plot (p1) does not apply transparency, with all group fill colors opaque. The graph is overall crowded, and there is significant overlap between groups, making it hard to interpret the information. The right plot (p2) applies transparency, making the color layering effects between different groups more prominent, thus allowing for a clearer observation of the density distribution characteristics of each group.\n\n# Create annotation framework\nannot &lt;- data.frame(\n  Species = c(\"setosa\", \"versicolor\", \"virginica\"),\n  x = c(1.8, 4, 5.1),  # Annotation positions for each species\n  y = c(0.5, 0.9, .8)\n)\n\n# Generate density plot\nggplot(filter(iris, Species %in% c(\"setosa\", \"versicolor\", \"virginica\")), aes(x = Petal.Length, color = Species, fill = Species)) +\n  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +\n  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +\n  scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +\n  geom_text(data = annot, aes(x = x, y = y, label = Species, color = Species), hjust = 0, size = 4.5) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  ) +\n  ylab(\"\") +\n  xlab(\"Petal Length (cm)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Multiple Groups Density Plot Using the Iris Dataset\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5 shows the distribution density of petal length (Petal.Length) for different species in the Iris dataset, allowing for a clear visualization of the distribution differences in petal length across species.\n\n\n4. Faceted Density Plot\nFacet density plots for multiple variables, by displaying data from different groups in different panels, allow for a more intuitive comparison of distribution differences between groups, reducing visual clutter. If all panels share the same X-axis, the distribution features of each group, such as central tendency, spread, and shape, can still be compared. Facet density plots for multiple variables are created using facet_wrap().\n\nggplot(data=diamonds, aes(x=price, group=cut, fill=cut)) +\n  geom_density(adjust=1.5) +\n  theme_ipsum() +\n  facet_wrap(~cut) + \n  theme(\n    legend.position=\"none\",\n    panel.spacing = unit(0.1, \"lines\"),\n    axis.ticks.x=element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Faceted Density Plot\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6 demonstrates the price distribution for different cut grades in the diamonds dataset. The density curve for each cut grade is displayed in separate facets, making it easier to observe the price distribution pattern of each cut grade within the same coordinate system.\n\n\n5. Stacked Density Plot\nIn a stacked density plot, the density distributions of different groups are stacked on top of each other, avoiding the confusion caused by overlapping curves. However, since the groups are stacked, it becomes difficult to understand the distribution of groups not at the bottom of the chart (facet density plots are recommended here).\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=diamonds, aes(x=price, group=cut, fill=cut)) +\n  geom_density(adjust=1.5, position=\"fill\") +\n  theme_ipsum()\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Stacked Density Plot\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7 shows the relative distribution of prices for different cut grades in the diamonds dataset. By using a stacked density plot (position=“fill”), the cumulative density for all groups at each price position sums to 1, making it easier to compare the relative density distributions of different cut grades.\n\n\n6. Marginal distributions (density plots)\nMarginal distributions provide additional information about the data, not only showing the relationships between variables but also revealing the independent distribution characteristics of each variable. Combining marginal density plots with scatter plots (or other main plots) offers a comprehensive view, making it easier to detect patterns, outliers, and trends in the data. Marginal distributions (density plots) can be drawn using the ggMarginal() function from the ggExtra package.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl), size = factor(cyl))) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = factor(cyl)), show.legend = TRUE) +  # Scatter plot with size variation based on cyl\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', formula = y ~ x, se = TRUE, linewidth = 1, aes(color = factor(cyl))) +  # Regression curve with color and width based on cyl\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#2e3b97\", \"#faad61\", \"#b76252\")) +  # Specifying colors for the regression curves\n  stat_poly_eq(aes(label = paste(after_stat(eq.label), after_stat(rr.label), after_stat(p.value.label), sep = \"~~~~\")), \n               formula = y ~ x, size = 4,\n               hjust = -1,   # Adjust horizontal alignment\n               vjust = 1.1,   # Adjust vertical alignment\n               position = position_nudge(x = 2.7, y = 1)) + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")  # Hide legend\n\n# Add marginal density plot to the scatter plot\np1 &lt;- ggMarginal(p, type=\"density\")  \n\np1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Marginal Density Plot\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatter plot shows the relationship between car weight (wt) and miles per gallon (mpg) for different cylinder counts (cyl) in the mtcars dataset. The marginal density plot shows the distribution patterns of wt (weight) and mpg (miles per gallon) for cars with different cylinder counts (cyl), revealing the differences in wt or mpg between the different cylinder groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCustomizable Parameters for Plots with Marginal Distributions\n\nChange the size of the marginal plot using the size parameter.\nCustomize the appearance of the marginal plot with common parameters.\nDisplay only one marginal plot (either the x or y axis) using margins = 'x' or margins = 'y'.\n\n\np &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl), size = factor(cyl))) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = factor(cyl)), show.legend = TRUE) +  # Scatter plot with size variation based on cyl\n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', formula = y ~ x, se = TRUE, linewidth = 1, aes(color = factor(cyl))) +  # Regression curve with color and width based on cyl\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"#2e3b97\", \"#faad61\", \"#b76252\")) +  # Specifying colors for the regression curves\n  stat_poly_eq(aes(label = paste(after_stat(eq.label), after_stat(rr.label), after_stat(p.value.label), sep = \"~~~~\")),\n               formula = y ~ x, size = 4,\n               hjust = -1.45,   # Adjusted horizontal alignment (modified value)\n               vjust = 1.1,   # Adjust vertical alignment\n               position = position_nudge(x = 2.7, y = 1)) + \n  theme(legend.position = \"none\")  # Hide legend\n\n# Marginal density plot\np2 &lt;- ggMarginal(p, type=\"density\", margins = 'x', color=\"purple\", size = 4)  # Display only x-axis marginal density plot\n\np2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Customizable Parameters for Plots with Marginal Distributions\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the previous plot, Figure 9 also shows the relationship between weight (wt) and miles per gallon (mpg) for cars with different numbers of cylinders (cyl) in the mtcars dataset. The marginal density plot illustrates the distribution pattern of cars with different cylinder counts (cyl) in terms of mpg (miles per gallon).\n\n\n\n\n7. Annotated Density Plot\nAnnotated density plots allow key information or group names to be displayed directly on the plot, making it easier to understand the distribution and differences of data across groups without relying on a legend. This enhances the readability of the plot and improves the efficiency of information delivery. You can add text or labels along the density curve using ggplot2 and the geomtextpath package.\n\nggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, colour = Species, label = Species)) +\n  geom_textdensity() +\n  theme_bw() + guides(color = 'none')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Annotated Density Plot\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10 represents the Sepal.Length distribution for different species in the iris dataset using text density curves. The text layout adjusts dynamically according to the density of the distribution, making it easier to visually observe the distribution of sepal length across species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nCustomizable Parameters for Labels in Annotated Density Plots\n\nChange the size of the text using the size parameter.\nCustomize the font style with the fontface parameter.\nAdjust vertical alignment with the vjust parameter.\nAdjust horizontal alignment with the hjust parameter. The last two parameters (vjust and hjust) can be floats (usually between -1 and 1) or strings such as xmid (or ymid), xmax (or ymax), and auto (default).\n\n\n\n\nmtcars$labels = ifelse(mtcars$vs==0, \"Type 0\", \"Type 1\")\nggplot(mtcars, aes(x = qsec, colour = as.factor(labels), label = as.factor(labels))) +\n  geom_textdensity(size = 6, fontface = 4, # Bold italic text\n                   vjust = -0.4, hjust = \"ymid\") +\n  theme_bw() + guides(color = 'none')  # Remove color guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Customizable Parameters for Annotated Density Plot\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11 shows the text density distribution of qsec (1/4 mile acceleration time) and vs (engine type) in the mtcars dataset. By adjusting text density properties, the labels become more noticeable and readable.",

    "text": "Visualization\n\n1. Basic Plotting\n\nBasic Plotting\nThe ggplot2 package allows the use of geom_boxplot() to create a basic boxplot.\nTaking the TCGA-BRCA.htseq_counts.tsv dataset as an example:\n\nggplot(data_TCGA1, aes(x=as.factor(gene_name), y=gene_expression)) + \n  geom_boxplot(fill=\"slateblue\", alpha=0.2) + # color fill and font size\n  xlab(\"gene_name\") # x-axis label\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter Adjustment\nTaking the mtcars dataset as an example:\n\nggplot(data_mtcars, aes(x=as.factor(cyl), y=mpg)) + \n  geom_boxplot(\n    # box\n    color=\"blue\",\n    fill=\"blue\",\n    alpha=0.2,\n    # notch\n    notch=TRUE,\n    notchwidth = 0.8,\n    # outliers\n    outlier.colour=\"red\",\n    outlier.fill=\"red\",\n    outlier.size=3\n  ) + \n  xlab(\"cyl\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColor Settings\nTaking the mpg dataset as an example, several common color scales for boxplots are demonstrated:\n\nggplot(data_mpg, aes(x=class, y=hwy)) + \n  geom_boxplot(color=\"red\", fill=\"orange\", alpha=0.2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data_mpg, aes(x=class, y=hwy, fill=class)) + \n  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.3) +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(data_mpg, aes(x=class, y=hwy, fill=class)) + \n  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.3) +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Dark2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup Highlighting\nTaking the mpg dataset as an example, different colors are set for groups that need to be highlighted:\n\ndata_mpg %&gt;% \n  # add highlighted group, create color vector\n  mutate(type=ifelse(class==\"subcompact\",\"Highlighted\",\"Normal\")) %&gt;%\n  # fill=type, map the color vector to the boxplot\n  ggplot(aes(x=class, y=hwy, fill=type, alpha=type)) + \n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_fill_manual(values=c(\"#69b3a2\", \"grey\")) +\n  scale_alpha_manual(values=c(1,0.1)) +\n  theme_ipsum() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\") +\n  xlab(\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Variable Width Boxplot\nThe basic boxplot does not display the sample size information of categories. We can draw a variable width boxplot where the box width is proportional to the sample size by using the varwidth parameter.\n\nnames &lt;- c(rep(\"A\", 20) , rep(\"B\", 5) , rep(\"C\", 30), rep(\"D\", 100))\nvalue &lt;- c(sample(2:5, 20 , replace=T) , sample(4:10, 5 , replace=T), sample(1:7, 30 , replace=T), sample(3:8, 100 , replace=T))\ndata &lt;- data.frame(names,value)\n# create corresponding x-axis labels\nmy_xlab &lt;- paste(levels(data$names),\"\\n(N=\",table(data$names),\")\",sep=\"\")\n\n# plotting\nggplot(data, aes(x=names, y=value, fill=names)) +\n  geom_boxplot(varwidth = TRUE, alpha=0.2) + # varwidth = TRUE achieves width proportional to sample size\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\") +\n  scale_x_discrete(labels=my_xlab)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTaking the mpg dataset as an example again:\n\nggplot(data_mpg, aes(x=class, y=hwy, fill=class)) + \n  geom_boxplot(varwidth = TRUE,alpha=0.3) +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Dark2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Boxplot for Continuous Variables\nFor continuous variables, we can use the cut_width() function to divide the continuous variable into intervals and then draw the boxplot.\nTaking the diamonds dataset as an example:\n\ndata_diamonds %&gt;%\n  # create a new variable, divide the continuous variable into intervals (0.5 as one interval)\n  mutate(bin=cut_width(carat, width=0.5, boundary=0)) %&gt;%\n  # plotting, use the divided intervals as x\n  ggplot(aes(x=bin, y=price)) +\n  geom_boxplot(fill=\"#69b3a2\") +\n  theme_ipsum() +\n  xlab(\"Carat\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Boxplot with Mean Values\nThe basic boxplot displays the median for each group. We can also use the stat_summary() function to add the mean value for each group to the boxplot.\n\nnames=c(rep(\"A\", 20) , rep(\"B\", 8) , rep(\"C\", 30), rep(\"D\", 80))\nvalue=c( sample(2:5, 20 , replace=T) , sample(4:10, 8 , replace=T), sample(1:7, 30 , replace=T), sample(3:8, 80 , replace=T) )\ndata=data.frame(names,value)\n# Plotting\np &lt;- ggplot(data, aes(x=names, y=value, fill=names)) +\n  geom_boxplot(alpha=0.7) +\n  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom=\"point\", shape=20, size=14, color=\"white\", fill=\"white\") +\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Set1\")\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the mpg dataset as an example again\n\nggplot(data_mpg, aes(x=class, y=hwy, fill=class)) + \n  geom_boxplot(varwidth = TRUE,alpha=0.3) +\n  stat_summary(fun.y=mean, geom=\"point\", shape=10, size=5, color=\"black\", fill=\"black\") +\n  # fun.y specifies the type of statistic to add, geom specifies the type of geometric object, shape specifies the shape of the point, and size specifies the size\n\n  theme(legend.position=\"none\") +\n  scale_fill_brewer(palette=\"Dark2\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Scatter Boxplot & Violin Plot\n\nScatter Boxplot\nBoxplots are often used to compare the distributions of multiple groups, but they do not show the specific distribution of the data (for example, it is impossible to determine whether the distribution is normal or bimodal from a boxplot). We can use the geom_jitter() function to add individual observations, allowing us to see the specific distribution of each group.\n\ndata &lt;- data.frame(\n  name=c( rep(\"A\",500), rep(\"B\",500), rep(\"B\",500), rep(\"C\",20), rep('D', 100)  ),\n  value=c( rnorm(500, 10, 5), rnorm(500, 13, 1), rnorm(500, 18, 1), rnorm(20, 25, 4), rnorm(100, 12, 1) )\n)\n\n\ndata %&gt;%\n  ggplot( aes(x=name, y=value, fill=name)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, alpha=0.6) +\n  geom_jitter(color=\"black\", size=0.4, alpha=0.9) + # Plotting scatter points\n  theme_ipsum() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position=\"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size=11)\n  ) +\n  ggtitle(\"A boxplot with jitter\") +\n  xlab(\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViolin Plot\nViolin plots combine the features of boxplots and density distribution plots, also showing the specific distribution of observations within groups.\n\ndata &lt;- data.frame(\n  name=c( rep(\"A\",500), rep(\"B\",500), rep(\"B\",500), rep(\"C\",20), rep('D', 100)  ),\n  value=c( rnorm(500, 10, 5), rnorm(500, 13, 1), rnorm(500, 18, 1), rnorm(20, 25, 4), rnorm(100, 12, 1) )\n)\n\ndata %&gt;%\n  ggplot( aes(x=name, y=value, fill=name)) +\n  geom_violin() +\n  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, alpha=0.6, option=\"A\") +\n  theme_ipsum() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position=\"none\",\n    plot.title = element_text(size=11)\n  ) +\n  ggtitle(\"Violin chart\") +\n  xlab(\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Grouped Boxplot\nOn the basis of single-group comparison, we can use the fill parameter to draw grouped boxplots, which facilitates comparisons both between and within groups.\n\nvariety=rep(LETTERS[1:4], each=40)\ntreatment=rep(c(\"high\",\"low\"),each=20)\nnote=seq(1:160)+sample(1:150, 160, replace=T)\ndata=data.frame(variety, treatment ,  note)\n\n# Plotting\nggplot(data, aes(x=variety, y=note, fill=treatment)) + # The fill parameter adds grouping\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding statistics analysis:\n\nvariety=rep(LETTERS[1:4], each=40)\ntreatment=rep(c(\"high\",\"low\"),each=20)\nnote=seq(1:160)+sample(1:150, 160, replace=T)\ndata=data.frame(variety, treatment ,  note)\n\n# Difference test\n# Within groups\ndf &lt;- data\ndf$variety &lt;- factor(df$variety)\ndf_p_val1 &lt;- df %&gt;% \n  group_by(variety) %&gt;% \n  wilcox_test(formula = note~treatment) %&gt;% \n  add_significance(p.col = 'p',cutpoints = c(0,0.001,0.01,0.05,1),symbols = c('***','**','*','ns')) %&gt;% \n  add_xy_position(x='variety')\n# Between groups\ndf_p_val2 &lt;- df %&gt;% \n  wilcox_test(formula = note~variety) %&gt;% \n  add_significance(p.col = 'p',cutpoints = c(0,0.001,0.01,0.05,1),symbols = c('***','**','*','ns')) %&gt;% \n  add_xy_position()\n\n\n# Plotting\nggplot()+\n  geom_boxplot(data = df,mapping = aes(x=variety, y=note, fill=treatment),width=0.5)+\n  stat_pvalue_manual(df_p_val1,label = '{p.signif}',\n                     tip.length = 0)+\n  stat_pvalue_manual(df_p_val2,label = '{p.signif}',\n                     tip.length = 0.01,\n                     y.position = df_p_val2$y.position+0.5)+\n  labs(x='variety',y='note')+\n  guides(fill=guide_legend(title = 'treatment'))+\n  theme_test()+\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = 'black'),\n        plot.caption = element_markdown(face = 'bold'),\n        legend.position = c(0.7,0.1),\n        legend.direction = 'horizontal')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to grouped boxplots, we can also draw boxplots for each subgroup separately for comparison.\n\nvariety=rep(LETTERS[1:7], each=40)\ntreatment=rep(c(\"high\",\"low\"),each=20)\nnote=seq(1:280)+sample(1:150, 280, replace=T)\ndata1=data.frame(variety, treatment ,  note)\n# treatment as the basis\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data1, aes(x=variety, y=note, fill=treatment)) + \n  geom_boxplot() +\n    facet_wrap(~treatment, scale=\"free\")+\n  labs(x='variety',y='note')+\n  guides(fill=guide_legend(title = 'treatment'))+\n  theme_test()+\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = 'black'),\n        plot.caption = element_markdown(face = 'bold'),\n        legend.position = c(0.9,0.1),\n        legend.direction = 'horizontal')\np1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# variety as the basis\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data1, aes(x=variety, y=note, fill=treatment)) + \n  geom_boxplot() +\n  facet_wrap(~variety, scale=\"free\")+\n  labs(x='variety',y='note')+\n  guides(fill=guide_legend(title = 'treatment'))+\n  theme_test()+\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = 'black'),\n        plot.caption = element_markdown(face = 'bold'),\n        legend.position = c(0.9,-0.05),\n        legend.direction = 'horizontal')\np2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7. Adding Marginal Distributions to Boxplots\nAdding marginal distributions on the X and Y axes is a common visualization method. We can achieve this using the ggExtra package. Here, we mainly introduce the addition of marginal distributions to boxplots.\nTaking the mtcars dataset as an example:\n\n# Original scatter plot\np1&lt;-ggplot(data_mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg, color=cyl, size=cyl))+\n  geom_point()+\n  theme_bw()+ \n  geom_smooth(method = 'lm', formula = y~x, se = TRUE, show.legend = FALSE) + \n  stat_poly_eq(aes(label = paste(..eq.label.., ..rr.label.., stat(p.value.label), sep = '~`,`~')),\n               formula = y~x, parse = TRUE, npcx= 'left', npcy= 'bottom', size = 4)\n\np1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Adding marginal boxplot distributions\np1 &lt;- ggMarginal(p1, type=\"boxplot\")\np1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nThe main customizable parameters of ggMarginal() are:\n\nsize to change the size of the marginal plot\nAll common appearance customization parameters\nmargins = 'x' or margins = 'y' to display only one marginal plot",

Grouped Violin Plot\nOn the basis of the basic violin plot, we can achieve intra-group comparison by setting the fill value.\nThe example below demonstrates intra-group comparison using the fill aesthetic. In this case, the penguins dataset is used. The x variable represents the species, and fill=sex creates an intra-group classification to visualize the comparison of flipper lengths within each species, grouped by gender.\n\nggplot(data_penguins, aes(fill=sex, y=flipper_length_mm, x=species)) + # Use X as the major classification and fill as the intra-group classification\n  geom_violin(position=\"dodge\", alpha=0.5, outlier.colour=\"transparent\") +\n  scale_fill_viridis(discrete=T, name=\"\") +\n  theme_ipsum()  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Grouped Violin Plot Using the penguins dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Half-Violin Plot\nA half-violin plot is useful for visualizing a large amount of data in a compact form. We can use the geom_half_violin function to display two groups separately.\nIn the following example, we visualize the flipper lengths of penguins for both species and genders, by plotting female and male penguins on opposite sides of the plot.\n\n# Separate the data for female and male penguins\ndata_female &lt;- data_penguins %&gt;% filter(sex == \"female\")\ndata_male &lt;- data_penguins %&gt;% filter(sex == \"male\")\n\n# Plot the half-violin plot for both groups (females on the right and males on the left)\nggplot() +\n  geom_half_violin(\n    data = data_female,\n    aes(y = flipper_length_mm, x = species),\n    position = position_dodge(width = 1),\n    scale = 'width',\n    colour = NA,\n    fill = \"#9370DB\",\n    alpha = 0.8,  ## Set transparency\n    side = \"r\"\n  ) +\n  geom_half_violin(\n    data = data_male,\n    aes(y = flipper_length_mm, x = species),\n    position = position_dodge(width = 1),\n    scale = 'width',\n    colour = NA,\n    fill = \"#FFFF00\",\n    alpha = 0.6,\n    side = \"l\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Half-Violin Plot Using the penguins dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Violin Plot Using the ggstatsplot Package\nThe ggstatsplot package extends ggplot2 by adding powerful statistical visualizations. The ggbetweenstats() function allows the creation of combined violin plots, box plots, and scatter plots.\nIn the following example, we visualize the distribution of bill lengths across different penguin species using the penguins dataset. We further enhance the plot’s aesthetics using the theme() function.\n\nplt &lt;- ggbetweenstats(\n  data = data_penguins,\n  x = species,\n  y = bill_length_mm\n) +\n# Beautification\n  labs(  ## Add labels and title\n    x = \"Penguins Species\",\n    y = \"Bill Length\",\n    title = \"Distribution of bill length across penguins species\"\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n    axis.line = element_line(colour = \"grey50\"),\n    panel.grid = element_line(color = \"#b4aea9\"),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_line(linetype = \"dashed\"),\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"#fbf9f4\", color = \"#fbf9f4\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#fbf9f4\", color = \"#fbf9f4\")\n  )\n\nplt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Violin Plot Using the ggstatsplot Package",

Histogram with Density Curve\nThe density curve provides a smooth representation of the data distribution.

Mirrored Histogram\nA mirrored histogram provides an intuitive way to compare the distributions of two datasets.

Overlapping Histograms on the Same Axis\nOverlaying or placing multiple histograms side by side on the same axis enables a direct comparison of distributions for two or more datasets within the same coordinate system. By adjusting colors and transparency, you can clearly visualize overlapping regions and distinguish between datasets. This technique is ideal for comparing 2–3 groups; more groups may lead to visual clutter, making the plot difficult to interpret.\n\np &lt;- data12 %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = expression, fill = var)) +\n  geom_histogram(color = \"#e9ecef\", alpha = 0.6, position = 'identity') +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"#69b3a2\", \"#404080\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Expression Value\", y = \"Count\", fill = \"Type\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\np\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Overlapping Histograms on the Same Axis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Faceted Histograms for Multiple Variables\nFaceted histograms provide a structured way to compare and analyze data across multiple variables or categorical groups by displaying them in separate panels.
