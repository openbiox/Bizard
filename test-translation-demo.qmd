# Introduction

This is a simple test file to demonstrate the auto-translate workflow functionality.

## Purpose

This file will test:

1. **Automatic translation generation**: The workflow should create `test-translation-demo.zh.qmd`
2. **Git commit**: The translated file should be committed to the PR
3. **AI-powered translation**: Using external OpenAI-compatible models

## Sample Content

Here is some sample biomedical content for translation:

**Gene Expression**: Gene expression is the process by which information from a gene is used to synthesize functional gene products, often proteins.

**Mutation Analysis**: Mutation analysis involves examining DNA sequences to identify variations that may be associated with disease or other phenotypes.

## Code Example

```r
# Load data
data <- read.csv("gene_expression.csv")

# Plot expression levels
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data, aes(x = gene, y = expression)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Conclusion

This test file will help verify that the auto-translate workflow is working correctly.
