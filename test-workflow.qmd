# Test Translation Workflow

This is a test file to verify the auto-translate workflow is working correctly after fixing the YAML syntax errors.

## Purpose

The purpose of this test file is to:

1. Trigger the auto-translate workflow
2. Verify that the workflow can run without YAML syntax errors
3. Test the translation functionality (if AI provider is configured)

## Expected Behavior

When this file is committed to the PR:

- The workflow should run successfully
- If an AI provider is configured, it should create a `test-workflow.zh.qmd` file
- If no AI provider is configured, the workflow should complete without errors

## Test Content

Here is some sample content for translation:

**Machine Learning**: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to improve their performance on a specific task through experience.

**Bioinformatics**: Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data, particularly when the data sets are large and complex.

## Conclusion

This test file should help validate that the auto-translate workflow is functioning correctly.
